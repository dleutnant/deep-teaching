## Day 1

1.  Getting Started/Two Ways to Teach <em>(9:00 - 9:10, 10min)</em> -
    **Greg**
    
      - `./keynote/00-introductions.key`
      - `./keynote/10-two-ways-to-teach.key`
      - Poll participants on how they learn better. Then point out that
        this doesn’t align with how people normally teach: lecture to
        “transfer” information.
      - Tell participants there’s lots of research (much of which people
        don’t know/act on)

2.  Novice/Competent Practitioner/Expert <em>(9:10 - 9:55, 45min)</em> -
    **Greg**
    
      - `./keynote/20-novice-competent-expert.key`
      - Mental models
          - Emphasize linkages: we rarely forget completely, but we lose
            the ability to retrieve
      - Mental models don’t have to be right to be useful
        (ball-and-spring models in chemistry)
      - How the graph model of human cognition expains the difference
        between competent and experts
          - Experts have more connections
      - Concept maps as visual representations of mental models
      - Using concept maps:
          - To design lesson
          - To convey information to learners
          - For insight into their learning
      - **Exercise**: draw and compare concept maps for RStudio’s
        professional products

3.  The Cognitive Craft <em>(9:55 - 10:40, 45min)</em> - **Garrett**
    
      - `./keynote/40-cognitive-craft.key`
      - Introduce cognitive architecture diagram
      - Introduce 7±2
      - Lesson “scenes” should fit into working memory
          - Use exercises/discussion/elaborative examples to keep new
            material there long enough to be transcribed
      - Poll - What’s better at conveying a mental model: Explanations
        or Exercises?
      - Cognitive load theory
          - Intrinsic
          - Extraneous
          - Germane
          - Tetris analogy
      - Describe how to apply this to explain something effectively
          - Begin with a simple mental model, preferably an analogy that
            leverages what they already know. Visualizations are an
            inherent analogy.
          - Build upon that, adding facts in a logical order
          - Connect to what they already know
          - Point out the limits of your mental model/analogy if
            necessary
      - **Exercise**: Write an explanation for why someone would use
        your favorite RStudio product, you will teach this later.
      - **Exercise**: What will your explanation not do?

4.  Coffee <em>(10:40 - 10:55, 15min)</em>

5.  Two Ways to Teach/Formative Assessment <em>(10:55 - 11:30,
    35min)</em> - **Greg**
    
      - Active vs. passive learners
          - Teaching is “load into short-term memory and keep it there
            long enough to be transferred”
      - Explain what active learning is: creates a real-time feedback
        loop in class
      - Importance of feedback loop while teaching (for instructor as
        well as learners)
      - Comparison with movie/play (add comedy improv)
      - MCQ example: 37 + 15 = a) 52 b) 42 c) 412 d) 43
      - Dual purposes of formative assessments (feedback loop +
        reinforcement)
      - **Exercise**: create question to figure out what someone on a
        support call doesn’t understand (diagnose misconceptions)

6.  Teaching as Performance I <em>(11:30 - 12:00, 30min)</em> - **Greg**
    
      - `./keynote/30-teaching-as-performance-1.key`
      - Critique the Nederbragt videos
          - [Bad](https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE)
          - [Good](https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY)
      - **Exercise**: teach in pairs: live coding / webinar style (no
        recording)

7.  **Homework**: Create a few slides that you could use to re-teach
    your content tomorrow, along with the script you will try to stick
    to.

## Day 2

1.  Review <em>(9:00 - 9:20, 20min)</em> - **Garrett**
    
      - Look at the [Divio
        Model](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/)
          - Tutorial
          - How-To
          - Explanation
          - Reference
      - Do these categories make sense in light of
        novice-competent-expert?
      - Do they make sense in terms of unconscious incompetence - to -
        unconscious incompetence?
      - Bloom’s Taxonomy (very briefly, with caveats)
          - Google isn’t enough if you don’t know what to search for or
            how to recognize a useful answer when you find one
          - Grolemund added “awareness” to the bottom of the Bloom
            hierarchy since it’s the most realistic goal for a workshop
            like this

2.  Motivation <em>(9:20 - 9:50, 30min)</em> - **Greg**
    
      - `./keynote/70-motivation.key`
      - If the student needs to expend the generative load, your job is
        to motivate them to do it
      - Three big motivators: self-efficacy, utility, community
      - Three big demotivators: unpredictability, unfairness,
        indifference
      - Zone of Proximal Development
      - **Exercise**: what demotivates people in programming demos and
        how do we prevent/fix it?
      - **Question**: can R syntax itself be
            demotivating?
          - [Study](http://neverworkintheory.org/2014/01/29/stefik-siebert-syntax.html)
            where Perl syntax was as hard to use as random symbols

3.  Multimedia Learning <em>(9:50 - 10:35, 45min)</em> - **Garrett**
    
      - `./keynote/80-multimedia-learning.key`
      - Dual coding theory
          - Revisit cognitive architecture diagram: signals are
            competing for channels
      - Critique some bad slides
      - **Exercise**: Take the slides that you made; make them more
        visual, altering your script if necessary.
      - **Exercise**: Do it again pushing it even farther.

4.  Coffee <em>(10:35 - 10:50, 15min)</em>

5.  Teaching as Performance II <em>(10:50 - 11:20, 30min)</em> -
    **Greg**
    
      - `./keynote/60-teaching-as-performance-2.key`
      - Use the previous day’s rubric
      - Two groups, everyone talks over the graphic they made overnight

6.  Group Exercise <em>(11:20 - 11:35, 15min)</em> - **Garrett**
    
      - What are the pros and cons of R Markdown for documentation,
        books, or slides from a cognitive point of view?
