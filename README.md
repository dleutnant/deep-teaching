# Deep Teaching

You've put deep learning on your todo list, but how about deep teaching? This one day workshop introduces education best practices to programmers and data scientists.

If you weren't able to attend our instructor training workshop at rstudio::conf, and would like to learn more about effective teaching, we have good news: the Education team is offering the workshop online for RStudio staff in March.  Among the topics we will cover are:

- how to figure out who your learners actually are,
- how the differences between novices, competent practitioners, and experts affect what and how you teach,
- using formative assessment to keep teaching on track in real time,
- what cognitive load is and how to design lessons that take it into account,
- teaching as a performance art, and
- what motivates and demotivates adult learners.

This workshop will be very interactive; in order to accommodate everyone's schedule, we will offer the training at an American-friendly time on Tuesday March 19 and at a European-friendly time on Tuesday March 26. If you are interested, please go to https://goo.gl/forms/EFmiq5Kv4sURayMe2 and let us know what time(s) work best for you - we'll schedule it to fit as many of your calendars as we can. If you have any questions, please Slack or email Greg Wilson.
