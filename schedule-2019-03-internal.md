## Day 1

1.  Two Ways to Teach/Formative Assessment (0:45/09:45) - Greg
    -   <./keynote/10-two-ways-to-teach.key>
    -   <./keynote/50-formative-feedback.key>
    -   Tell participants there's lots of research (much of which people don't know/act on)
    -   Active vs. passive learners
    -   Comparison with movie/play (add comedy improv)
    -   Introduce cognitive architecture diagram
        -   Teaching is "load into short-term memory and keep it there long enough to be transferred"
    -   Explain what active learning is: creates a real-time feedback loop in class
    -   Importance of feedback loop while teaching (for instructor as well as learners)
    -   MCQ example: 37 + 15 = a) 52 b) 42 c) 412 d) 43
    -   Dual purposes of formative assessments (feedback loop + reinforcement)
    -   Exercise: create question to figure out what someone on a support call doesn't understand (diagnose misconceptions)

1.  Novice/Competent Practitioner/Expert (0:45/10:30) - Garrett
    -   <./keynote/20-novice-competent-expert.key>
    -   Mental models
        -   Emphasize linkages: we rarely forget completely, but we lose the ability to retrieve
    -   Mental models don't have to be right to be useful (ball-and-spring models in chemistry)
    -   How the graph model of human cognition expains the difference between competent and experts
        -   Experts have more connections
    -   Concept maps as visual representations of mental models
    -   Using concept maps:
        -   To design lesson
        -   To convey information to learners
        -   For insight into their learning
    -   Exercise: draw and compare concept maps for RStudio's professional products

1.  Coffee (0:15/10:45)

1.  Teaching as Performance I (0:30/11:15) - Greg
    -   <./keynote/30-teaching-as-performance-1.key>
    -   Critique the Nederbragt videos
        -   Bad: <https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE>
        -   Good: <https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY>
    -   Exercise: teach in pairs: live coding / webinar style
        -   No recording

1.  Multimedia Learning (0:45/12:00) - Garrett
    -   <./keynote/80-multimedia-learning.key>
    -   Dual coding theory
        -   Revisit cognitive architecture diagram again: signals are competing for channels
    -   Overnight exercise: create a visual to explain how a dplyr pipeline works
        -   Add to a Google Doc for review tomorrow

## Day 2

1.  Review (0:30/09:30) - Garrett
    -   Look at diagrams and questions from previous day

1.  The Cognitive Craft (0:45/10:15) - Garrett
    -   <./keynote/40-cognitive-craft.key>
    -   Revisit cognitive architecture diagram and graph model of memory
    -   Tetris analogy
    -   Introduce 7 +/- 2
    -   Lesson "scenes" should fit into working memory
        -   Use exercises/discussion/elaborative examples to keep new material there long enough to be transcribed
    -   Cognitive load theory
        -   Intrinsic
        -   Extraneous
        -   Germane
    -   Exercise: FIXME

1.  Teaching as Performance II (0:30/10:45) - Greg
    -   <./keynote/60-teaching-as-performance-2.key>
    -   Use the previous day's rubric
    -   Two groups, everyone talks over the graphic they made overnight

1.  Coffee (0:15/11:00)

1.  Motivation (0:30/11:30) - Greg
    -   <./keynote/70-motivation.key>
    -   Three big motivators: self-efficacy, utility, community
    -   Three big demotivators: unpredictability, unfairness, indifference
    -   Zone of Proximal Development
    -   Exercise: what demotivates people in programming classes and how do we prevent/fix it?

1.  Group Exercise (0:30/12:00) - Garrett
    -   Look at the [Divio Model](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/)
        -   Tutorial
        -   How-To
        -   Explanation
        -   Reference
    -   Do these categories make sense in light of novice-competent-expert?
    -   Do they make sense in terms of unconscious incompetence - to - unconscious incompetence?
    -   Bloom's Taxonomy (very briefly, with caveats)
        -   Google isn't enough if you don't know what to search for or how to recognize a useful answer when you find one
        -   GG added "awareness" to the bottom of the Bloom hierarchy since it's the most realistic goal for a workshop like this
    -   What are the pros and cons of R Markdown for documentation, books, or slides from a cognitive point of view?
